Function timeeeee
    Syntax
        Py does not use the function keyword or curly braces;
        we instead use the def keyword -> remembering to use snake_case;

        def greet(person=None):
            if person == None:
                name = input('What is your name?')
                return f'Hello there, {name}!'
            else: return f'Hello there, {person}!'
    
    Arguments:
        if we define a function with args we must use all of them;
        This is why it was critical to pass person=None in func above;
        This can get annoying when we have many arguments and have to track their order;

        Py lets us use named args to get around this pesky order problem
        when we call a function we can structure it like:

        complex_function(arg2 = '', arg1 = '', etc;);
    
    Helper funcs:
        help(funcName) will return the signature of that func ie:
        help(complex_function) -> (arg2 = '', arg1 = '', etc);

        dir(any_item) -> will list all available methods on that item;
        help gives more information, but dir is quicker;
        We must include a docstring in our functions if we want them to properly respond 
        to dir or help 

        a docstring is just a string in the first line of our def:
        def add_two_nums(a,b):
            """Expects two numbers, adds them together""
            return a+b
