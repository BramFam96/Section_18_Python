say we have file-> file.py with the following in it:
age = 19;
guests = 0;
if age >=18
    print('Welcome!')
    guests += 1

we can execute this file two ways:
    1
        python3 path or file.py;
        prints 'Welcome!'
        and return us to a regular console
    2 
    we initialize ipython;
    within it we can execute a file with %run path or file.py
    this will execute and remain in the ipython environment

    in this env we have access to our varibles -> age and guests;
    they will equate to their final values after execution;
