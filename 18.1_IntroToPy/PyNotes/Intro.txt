Python
    Python is initiated with ipython in the console.
    In most cases where it differs from JS it is far simpler;

    Variables

        vars are lexically scoped, and not delcared with a keyword;
        the syntax is snake_case all lower-cased with _ between words;
        const do not exist. instead we just capitalize consts to
        signify they shouldn't be changed

    TYPES
        like Js vars can be assigned new types of values; (loosely typed)
        also like js data types come with inheret methods and limitations
        we can check our vars type any time with type(var);
        

    Nums

        there are multiple number types in Py -> int and float;
        nums with decimals are floats;
        we can easily convert them with float() and int();

        we also have a num // num division method that floors our answer;
        if we want to preserve float values we can use round(num, #decimal_places);
        additionally we can use is_integer() to check if float is whole num;


    Strings

        Python uses "" or '' like js;

        It also includes the triple quote: '''...''' or """...""";
        which lets us define strings across multiple lines;

        it also has f-strings that work like string template literals;

        food = 'cheese'
        print(f'I love {food}')

        Boom! Even simpler than JS;

    Lists

        Lists are analgous to arrays in Js; just an ordered list;
        We'll cover them in detail in a later section; for now its sufficient to note
        that we can store heterogeneous data in them just like js arrays:

        first_list = [1, 'john', true]
    Booleans

    null is replaced with None; None just signifies an empty value;

    
    Notes on conditionals can be found at conditional.txt;


    Input Command 
    b/c py runs in our console we can simply use input('some text') to prompt users to 
    respond to our program;

    answer =10
    guess= None;
    while guess != answer:
        guess = input('Guess a number from 1-10! (..psst it's 10!)')
        if guess == 'q' or guess = 'quit:
            break;
        guess = int(guess);
    print('out of while loop')
