# OO Review:

# class:
    # a blue print for new objects;
#method:
    #function defined on the class that can see/change attributes on instances
#class methd
    #function defined on the class that are called on the class, not the instance;
from collections import Counter

my_counter = Counter('some nonsense');
# OOP in Py
    #  get/set attributes with dot notation (objs != dicts)
    #  call method: obj.method()
# help(obj) -> show how the object and its methods work
# dir(obj) -> lists all methods/props/attributes on the obj;
