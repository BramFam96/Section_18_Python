Like JS Arrays Py lists are reference data types;
if we assign a list to a previous list they will point to the 
same data in memory. 

ie list1 is list2 and changing one will change the other;

List declarations:

    literal syntax: 
    list = [1,2,3];

    constructor syntax:
    letters = list('apple'); -> ['a','p','p','l','e'];

in operator:
    check if a list contains something with in
    if 'taco' in foods:
        print('Cronch-smack');

    range limits
    in Js if we iterate beyond the limit of a arr we get undefined;
    Py will not throw undefined, it will error and stop executing;

    this will occur even if we try to add beyond the range; 
list[len(list)] = 'dog'; will not work!
