Str are immutable but iterable;
therefor we cannot splice new character into them;
we can construct new strings with str(el);

We have slice, we can use in, and we have various methods;
Methods:

    find them in python ds handout or easypythondocs;
    OR
    if we dir[str] or dir[''] we can get a list of their methods;
    if we're confused about any, we can always help(str.method) for a full
    description of expected inputs and outputs;
    
    str.find('char') -> has unexpected return;
    if char does not exist we will get -1, despite -1 being a valid index;
